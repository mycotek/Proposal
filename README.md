# Overview

The scripts to be written for the process are:

1. One to setup the folder structure (setup.sh)
2. One that will download a gene given an organism name (getFasta.py)
3. One that will BLAST the downloaded gene, and create a phylogenetic tree from the BLAST results (doBlast.sh)
5. A script that runs all the other scripts (main.sh)

More detail on the scripts can be found in project_documentation.md
