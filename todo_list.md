# Todo List 

1. Create script to setup the folder structure and create an environment (setup.sh)
2. Create a script that will pull fasta files from NCBI from an organism search (getFasta.py)
3. Create a script that uses mycotools to blast to blast a gene from the organism (doBlast.sh)
4. Create a script that uses mycotools to generate a phylogenetic tree (doBlast.sh)

Note: It was easier to have steps 3 and 4 in one script (doBlast.sh)
